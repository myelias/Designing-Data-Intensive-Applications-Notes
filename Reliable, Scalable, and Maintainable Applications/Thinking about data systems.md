## A service is ***scalable*** if it results in increased performance in a manner proportional to resources added. Generally, increasing performance means serving more units of work, but it can also be to handle larger units of work, such as when datasets grow.

## Performance vs Scalability:  
## • If you have a performance problem, your system is slow for a single user  
## • If you have a scalability problem, your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load.

## ***Reliability*** - tolerating hardware & software, human error  
## ***Scalability*** - measuring load & performance, latency percentiles, throughput  
## ***Maintainability*** - operability, simplicity & evolvability
